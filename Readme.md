🚧 Pothole Detecting, Locating & Alert System Using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

Potholes on roads are a significant issue, leading to vehicle damage, accidents, and costly repairs. This project proposes an automated pothole detection system using Machine Learning (ML). The system analyzes road images/videos and detects potholes in real-time, leveraging state-of-the-art YOLOv5 object detection model.

📜 Features

✅ Real-time pothole detection

✅ High accuracy (up to 84%) in pothole identification

✅ Live camera feed support added

✅ Custom pothole dataset used for model training

✅ Image preprocessing & augmentation to enhance model performance
